                            Below, we are mentioning some of the basic amenities provided by the bus operators:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Clean buses</li>
                            <li>Movies and songs for entertainment</li>
                            <li>Water bottles</li>
                            <li>Snacks</li>
                            <li>Hands sanitizer</li>
                            <li>Wet napkins</li>
                            <li>Disposable seat covers</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="font-size:large">
                            These amenities are available in almost all the buses listed on BookMyTrip. 
                            But a comparison can also be made between different bus operators before booking bus tickets.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-size:large">Non-AC buses are cheaper than Volvo or AC buses.
                            So, the amenities offered in buses differ depending on their type. 
                            For example, you will get a charging point in Volvo but no such facility is offered in ordinary buses.
                            You will also get personal fans and reading lights in Volvo. 
                            Although toilet facilities are not available inside most of the buses, there will be plenty of stoppages at different restaurants where you can freshen up.
                            So, depending on your budget, you can choose a bus that meets your requirements.
                            Especially if you are on a longer journey, a comfortable mode of transport is extremely important.
